The price can vary from £1-£2 per bar for the exact same bar. I've only seen the £1 per bar when my local supermarket had buy 1 get 1 free and the bars were £2 which is what a lot of stores charge.

Kind bars are generally quite good for your; their sales pitch is ingredients you can see. In this case the bar is mostly almonds held together by caramel. As a result The 40g bar is 7.3g of Fibre, ~6g of protein and ~5g of sugar so the energy from the bar lasts. Between the caramel and almonds you are accounting for 81% of the weight of the bar. I don't want to comment if this is healthy for you or not its 203cal in 40g. The nuts high protein do make you feel fuller for longer.The taste is excellent with the caramel and almonds really working nicely together. Unlike the Kind Bar, Dark Chocolate / Nuts & Sea Salt the salt was much more subtle; adding to the overall experience rather than being a significant flavor.The flavor is nice (the apple one was nicest to my tastebuds but has most sugar) and compared to my previous kind bars this is the healthiest; I just don't enjoy the texture of a bar that is basically pure almond with some flavor.

I feel quite ill after eating a couple of bites and the taste gets worse as you chew and swallow. They could not POSSIBLY have done a taste test or quality check before these left the factory. These need to be re-thought. Awful!,3,overpowered by salt,,,,,,
